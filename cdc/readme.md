Designing a comprehensive CDC framework in Python using PySpark that can handle multiple sources and sinks with auto-determined change detection requires a flexible and modular architecture. This outline provides a starting point for such a framework, focusing on extensibility and the ability to automatically identify changes based on the latest timestamp or condition from the sink system. The implementation details for each source and sink type can vary significantly, so we'll focus on establishing a framework that can be extended as needed.

## Framework Structure
The framework will consist of abstract classes for source and sink adapters, a CDC engine to manage data flow and change detection, and concrete adapter implementations for different types of sources and sinks.


Step 1: Define Abstract Base Classes for Source and Sink Adapters

Step 2: Implement a CDC Engine
The CDC engine will use the source and sink adapters to read data, identify changes, and write updates.

Step 3: Implement Concrete Adapters
You'll need to implement concrete adapters for each source and sink type. Here's an example for a database source and sink:



Step 4: Extensibility for New Sources and Sinks
To add new sources or sinks, implement the SourceAdapter and SinkAdapter interfaces, respectively. For instance, to add an SFTP source, you'd create an SFTPSourceAdapter class that implements the read method to fetch data from an SFTP server.


### Note
This framework is a simplified example to demonstrate the concept. Real-world scenarios may require handling complex transformations, dealing with various data formats, ensuring fault tolerance, and managing schema evolution. Each source and sink type (e.g., SFTP, Object Storage, API) will have its own specifics for reading and writing data, which would need concrete adapter implementations. For APIs and Object Storage, you may need to use or develop custom Spark connectors or use intermediary storage formats for processing.
